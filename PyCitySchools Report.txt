Analysis summary

Fifteen high schools schools were analyzed with a total of 39,170 students.  Math, reading and combined math 
and reading scores were analyzed based on average spent per student, grade, size of the school attended, 
and type of school (district versus charter) in order to derive insights on the what characteristics 
correlate with highest and lowest performance in these subject areas.  Performance was defined as scoring >70 
in the subject of interest or both subjects in the case of overall passing score.  


Conclusions or comparisons from the calculations

Seven district and eight charter schools were included in this analysis.  School size varied from
427 (Charter - Holden) to 4976 (District - Bailey). Budget ranged from $248,087 (Charter - Holden) to $3,124,928 (District -
Bailey). The top 5 performing schools were Charters with <2,500 students each. The 5 worst performing schools were districts
with ~3000+ students each. When examining performance by grade for each school, percent passing reading, math and overall 
were stable 9th through 12th grade.  Thus overall school passing rates were used in the remainder of the analysis since 
there was no indication of a differnce in performance across grade level.

School budget allocated per student was divided into the following categories:<$585, $585-630, $630-645, $645-680. 
Overall passing average was 90% for <$585, 81% for $585-630, 63% for $630-645 and 54% for $645-680 spent per student.
Of note, 4 out 8 Charters had the lowest spends while achieving high passing rates.  While the data indicates 
a trend that lower spending leads to higher performance (and conversely that higher spends per student do not 
lead to higher performance), more information is needed on how school budget is allocated (salaries, overhead etc.)
within each school.

Schools considered small (<1000 students) and medium (1000-2000) had similar overall passing rates 89.8%
and 90.6% respectively. Large schools (2000-5000) had considerably worse outcomes at 58.2% overall passing rate.
Within large schools, proportion passing math was 69.9%. Students passing reading was higher at 82.7%, 
indicating that math is the area driving down performanace in larger schools.

Lastly, students passing both math and reading was 90% in charter schools and 53% in distric schools. Consistent
with the school size results, math was the subject leading to overall lower passing rate.  In district schools,
66% of students passed math, compared to 93% in charter schools. Differnce in reading passing rates across school 
types was less striking, 96% and 80% in charter and district schools respectively.
